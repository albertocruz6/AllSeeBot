## [ALL SEE BOT](https://twitter.com/AllSeeBot)
- Project with the intention to explore the Discord.py API and the Tweepy API working in unison
- Bot has functions that can be prompted in twitter and in discord \[mutually exclusive\]:
	- Discord:
		- Track tweets from specific users
		- Monitor server members 
	- Twitter:
		- Generate arbitrary tweets with webscraping scripts
		- Interact with replies and commands to generate images/tweets/videos
		- Make polls using the DM's
- Overall it's just for fun. Integrating knowledge of databases and algorithm design to improve many of the key features in it
- Discord link upon request! \[soon as a feature!\]
